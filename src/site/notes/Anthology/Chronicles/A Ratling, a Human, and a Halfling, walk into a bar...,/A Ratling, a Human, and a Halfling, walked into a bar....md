The Wizardâ€™s Tower Brewing Co. - a craft brewery known for its hoppy summer ales - is in dire need of help from a band of reliable, affordable adventurers. The owner has posted a job on the local notice boards and is calling in favors from friendly innkeepers all over town to spread the word.

> *"Rats! Giant Rats the size of dogs, I tell you! And not the small cute dogs either, no, these were no dear poodles."*

-- Glowkindle, explaining the threat from the cellars.
# The Meeting
3 different individuals  have come to take notice of posting in various place and have, by chance, come to the Wizard's Tower Brewing Co. at the same time. They introduced themselves  as [[Characters/Hoppe the Rat\|Hoppe the Rat]], a Ratling cleric, [[Characters/Theo Calbus\|Theo Calbus]], a Human palading, and [[Characters/Ligaya\|Ligaya]], a Halfling druid who came from distant lands, and thus, the trio proceeded to knock at the brewery's door. [[Glowkindle\|Glowkindle]], the bearded gnome who runs the brewery, looked at them and asked if they were there for the job postings that he has spread around. Getting a nod of confirmation, Glowkindle ushered them inside and explained the events leading to the breach of the walls of the cellar and the appearance of the giant rats. After listening to the gnome, with a mug of delicious ale, they readily agreed to job and proceeded down the cellars immediately. 

> *"Uh, are you sure that you're here for the posting?"* 

-- *Glowkindle, after Ligaya kept introducing herself.*

# Giant Rats, oh my!
With Theo at the front, they were able to perceive the group of 8 giant rats that the gnome described. The battle was not easy, with little experience between the 3 of them, they quickly got surrounded by superior numbers and ferocity of the oversized pests, but they weren't completely useless. Theo was able to slice of 2 of the rats pretty quickly with his battleaxe, with Hoppe bashing in a giant rat's skull in with his mace. Ligaya was able to rain down on the rats with multiple *Ray of Frosts* while staying behind Hoppe. As a paladin and cleric, Theo and Hoppe was able to heal themselves while taking several life threatening bites. 

The situation was turning dire when both Theo and Hoppe fell unconscious from taking too many hits. Ligaya then was able to deflect and dodge multiple attacks in a row but was not able to consistently finish off the giant rats. This was when a shadow came down from top of the stairs, drew his sword, and sliced off the head of one of the giant rats. A customer of the brewery have heard the commotion from above and decided to lend a hand. Jerome the fighter was then able to slide off the rails of the stairs, dodged the attack from one of the rats, and helped the unconscious Hoppe back up. With a good aim, Ligaya was able to kill one of the rats harassing her and deftly moved to the downed Theo, helping him up.  At that point, with the help of the newcomer, the group was able to finish off the remaining giant rats.

> *"I need to freeze my dinner first before cooking.*

-- Ligaya, talking out loud after hitting multiple giant rats with her *Ray of Frosts*.

# A Puzzle? Nope.
With the threat dealt with, the group decided to rest and recover from their injuries. Hoppe also took a rat's corpse with them, one that was named '*Gerogio*', which they investigated the hole at the back of the cellar. They looked and prodded the hole, took some lanterns with them, and climbed through one by one. They came upon a hallway with one end caved in and the other rounding to a turn. After investigating both ends of the hallway that they found themselves in, Theo sneakily led the group and peaked around the only turn of the hallway.  Here they found, a mosaic pattern on the floor, with verses written on the wall.

> *Dawn breaks with stirring air, As sun shines down on new day fair
> 
> Midday blaze brakes earth and grass, The farmer waits for heat to pass
> 
> Evening cool brings water, wine, Drink and laughter passing time
> 
> Night sees shining, roaring fire, as wood and coals burn on the pyre*

On the floor was a cut body carcass of a giant rat. Thinking on their feet, the group decided to take *Gerogio's* corpse and threw it on the mosaic floor, where a blade sprang up and cut it in two. With a bright idea now on their mind, they took the rest of the 7 corpses of the giant rats and threw them all on the floor, figuring out which spots did not spring the blades. At the end of the hallway, they come to face two wooden doors, where Theo chose the farthest door, leading to the well room. 

> *"Just pass the corpses!"*

-- Hoppe to Ligaya, after Ligaya wanting to see the mosaic floor first. (She was apparently at the back of the group)

# Vigorously Touching
The well room was a rather small room, it had the well at its center, a part of the room caved in a corner, and there were cutleries in a table in the far corner. Theo entered without fanfare and proceeded to inspect the room. He was not quiet about it though and his first inquiry was the well itself. The well where 3 giant centipedes came bursting out, trying to knock him out. Theo was able to dodge out of the way though, and move to the door, completely parrying and deflecting all of the 3 centipede's attacks. The commotion got the attention of the group following outside, and quickly rushed in to help. Hoppe casted *Sacred Flame* multiple times, attacking the closest centipede, Ligaya rushed in between peoples legs, using her *Halfling Nimbleness* and shooting out *Ray of Frosts* on all centipedes, as well as using *Poison Spray* on the last remaining centipede. The battle was quick, and the group dealt with the centipedes swifter than the giant rats. 

They then clean up by looking around the room and finding several plates that are worth some money when cleaned up. Theo was hurt during the fight and decided to cast *Lay on Hands* and started touching himself vigorously as he healed himself. In a corner of the room. Away from the direction of the rest of the group.

> * *Touching noises* *

-- Theo Calbus, as he furiously heals himself.

# Now Way It Was This Easy...
Done with the well room, the team proceeded to tackle the next door from the hallway. sneakily, Theo opens the door and enter the room with making too much noise. He saw scorch marks all around the room, with most of the books and bookshelves in various degrees of burnt. As Theo looked around while behind one of the scorched bookshelves at the center of the room, he saw at the southwest corner of the room, up in the ceiling boards, a giant spider made of flames. With 8 legs and almost as many eyes that flared red of fire, it was aware that something was different because of the light from the torches but wasn't aware of the intruders to its territory. Theo, quietly, informed of the threat to his companions outside, and readily took action. He took out his javelin, with a good, steady aim, and a mighty throw, the javelin hit the Giant Spider of flames right in the torso, impaling itself quite deeply. The creature screeched and thrashed and fell from the ceiling, when Ligaya entered and casted a *Ray of Frost* that hit the spider as well. With anger and fury driving it mad, the spider moved forward towards the adventurers and spewed a webbing made out of flames, but Theo was successfully able to dodge the attack. Hoppe then came into the room behind Ligaya and blanched the room with radiant light, casting *Guiding Bolt* at the spider. 4 rays of radiant energy shimmered into being and shot at the spider, all 4 hitting the head, bashing it in and killing it. They stood, watching as the creature took its last breath, and realized, that they have dealt with this massive creature of fire, far better than they did the group of Giant Rats at the beginning.

They quickly took note of the room and found the Wizard's Spellbook, finding spells inside that might prove useful in the future, or profitable.

> *'That was it? The Giant Rats were harder!'*

-- Collective thought of the group after felling the the Giant Flaming Spider

# Potions For You, Potions For You, Everyone Gets Potions!
The store room was not big at all, it looked to have stored all of the potions and other alchemical products that the wizard used to have. Almost all of the bottles that used to store strange concoctions were now pristine dust. They then noticed a flicker of movement on one of the shelves, presenting itself as a rat that was drinking from a puddle of something. Theo was quick to brandish his battle-axe and swung down on the rat as it starts to grow larger. As the head of teh rat is removed from its body, the rest of the group notice a paper with the note written as

> *-potion of enlarg-*

After the quick tension, the group finds 4 potions that they split up between the 3 main cohorts. Ligaya gets 2 potions as she won a bet against the others.

> *"Huh, it's all shelves..."*

--Theo Calbus, after missing the rat drinking from a puddle near his feet.

# Those Giant Rats Alone Is Worth An Increase In The Rewards, You Know?
Returning to the top of the stairs of the cellar, into the brewery proper, they were greeted by Glowkindle, anxiously waiting for them and their success. 

> *"Is it done?"
> 
> "Yes it's done."
> 
> "Excelle-"
> 
> "But. I would ask for a bit of an increase in payment. A flaming spider was not really in leagues with giant rats, you agree? Actually, those giant rats alone are worth the increase in payment."*

--Conversation between Glowkindle and Theo about an increase in rewards. He was arguing compensation because he got knocked down (Taken from Ligaya's description of the event).





-------------------------------------------------------------------------


> *"The adventure ended there, with the trio taking Glowkindle's offer to take rest on the rooms above the brewery and dinner for the night, as well as an increase in the quest rewards. This served as the start to the future adventures that will consist of these 3 characters as well as their future companions."*
