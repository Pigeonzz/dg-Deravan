**Backstory**
	Ligaya is a daughter of a prestigious leader (Father) of Maharlika group and a highly respected goddess (Mother) of Diwata. Growing up, she always solve things on her own both with her intelligence and nature magic, such as stopping the rain during rituals by creating a protective layer using the air or even fighting the annoying low-life rogues stealing food from the community's farm using human pranks. Ligaya is indeed the community's gem and she always brings happiness to the people around her (just like her name, Ligaya — meaning "joy"). However, on her birthday, yesterday, an avoidable tradition of being part of Maharlika had unexpectedly come — a promised marriage to the prince of another Maharlika group three oceans away from her home and it's going to happen in five days. Ligaya expressed a strong frustration to her parents that lead to her father using his physical force, but her mother saved her using the earth barrier from the ground. The family all left shocked with what the turnaround of events due to strong emotions they all feel. Ligaya used her newly trained magic to disappear to Diwata world & both parents suddenly realized how painful this tradition would be for her. For the next three days after the incident, Ligaya stayed over at her grandparents without her parents knowing. Ligaya's parents were worried sick for sure both for her safety and what to do next when the prince comes. But she couldn't care less. She then wandered around the area and found a mysterious pathway she's never seen before. Of course, a curious mind like hers knows no boundaries so she decided to check it out. The path lead her to today's scenario.
