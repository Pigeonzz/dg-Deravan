**Backstory**
	Theo Calbus was born in a remote coastal village, a place where the ocean’s mist kissed the cliffs each morning and the stars shone brighter than anywhere else. His father, a fisherman, and his mother, a healer, taught him the value of patience, kindness, and hard work. At the age of twelve, tragedy struck—raiders burned the village in the night, leaving Theo one of the few survivors. Rescued by a wandering paladin of the Order of the Silver Dawn, he was taken to the chapter’s fortress to be raised and trained.
	The years that followed were filled with rigorous martial discipline, scripture study, and meditative reflection. Theo found purpose in protecting others from the cruelty of the world and swore himself to the Paladin’s path. His loyalty to the Order runs deep, but his true drive is rooted in a personal vow—no one under his watch will ever face the same helpless terror he felt that night.
